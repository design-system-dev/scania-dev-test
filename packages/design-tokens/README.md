# design-tokens

Generates design tokens via [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/).

Package for managing and generating our design tokens in all needed formats.

This setup is mostly for demonstrative purposes, since for a project of this scale a plain file of CSS custom properties would have been enough.

## Ideas for improvements

-   Roll out more types of tokens
    -   animation tokens
    -   more detailled typography tokens
    -   media query sizes
    -   etc

## Scripts

```bash
## build tokens
yarn build

## build tokens on file change
yarn dev
```
